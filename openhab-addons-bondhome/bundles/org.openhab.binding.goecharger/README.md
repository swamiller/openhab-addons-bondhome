# Go-eCharger Binding

This Binding controls and reads data from the [Go-eCharger](https://go-e.co/).
It is a mobile wallbox for charging EVs and has an open REST API for reading data and configuration.

## Supported Things

This binding supports Go-eCharger HOME+ with 7.4kW or 22kW.

## Thing Configuration

The thing has two configuration parameters:

| Parameter       | Description                                   | Required |

## Setting charge current of Go-eCharger based on photovoltaik output

You can easily define rules to charge with PV power alone.
Here is a simple sample how such a rule could look like:

```
rule "Set max amps for PV charging"
when
    Item availablePVCurrent received update
then
    logInfo("Amps available: ", receivedCommand.state)
    MaxAmpere.sendCommand(receivedCommand.state)
end
```
You can also define more advanced rules if you have multiple cars that charge with a different amount of phases.
For example if your car charges on one phase only, you can set maxAmps to output of PV power, if your car charges on two phases you can set maxAmps to `pv output / 2`, and for 3 phases `pv output / 3`.
In general the calculation would be Â´maxAmps = pvOutput / phases`.
